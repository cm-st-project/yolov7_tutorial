# yolov7_tutorial

This repository is an example of YOLOv7.  Where we download the pre-trained YOLOv7 from PyTorch Hub and perform object detection on sample images.

YOLO (You Look Only Once) is a well-known name for object detection. Joseph Redmon from the University of Washington developed the original versions (YOLOv1, v2, and v3) and he stopped working on them. However, other people continue the development of YOLO after that. Alexey Bochkovskiy developed YOLOv4 by forking and improving Darknet from Joseph Redmonâ€™s GitHub. Ultralytics developed YOLOv5 using PyTorch. WongKinYiu develop YOLOv7.
## Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Note:
Create a directory called "models" and Download the pretrained model from here: https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7.pt
